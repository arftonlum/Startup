#Notes for this class

Questions:
WHat is DNS? New name for an IP address. 
Dig and whois are codes to be executed in my linus server that basically look up the author of a webpage.
What is my production environment?

What is aria-hidden

Theory time npm handles nodejs which is just a type of file basically. Why we make stuff in Node? I don't know.
git.ignore is a file that I ignore
Http request means when we google it? Routing function?
What is JSON and JSON string?

Syntax made app with express then app.use([path,] callback(req,res,next))
if you do not call next then no following middleware functions will be invoked for the request.
Example app.use(function callback(req,res,next){
console.log('Time: ${Date.now()}, method: ${req.method}, path ${req.path}');
next();
});

Add disabled state to ok button, change button effects on play game stage, add pressed state to nav buttons, Add colors or something to leaderboard, add pedastal background on leaderboard page

Add then commit then checkout to go back
Here is the [Read Me](https://github.com/arftonlum/Startup/blob/120faff65610e42ff73fcddaa14e411d22b16a56/README.md).

Next up it looks like I got to get a DNS and stuff. Also, today we learned about h(a)ogan who made CSS, tim burners who made HTML and Brendan Eich who made Javascript.

The Caddyfile is the configuration file for your web service gateway. The public_html directory contains all of the static files that you are serving up directly through Caddy when using it as a web service. We will cover Caddy configuration in a later instruction. The services directory is the place where you are going to install all of your web services once you build them.

1/19/24 Caddy is a web service that listens for incoming HTTP requests. Caddy then either serves up the requested static files or routes the request to another web service. This ability to route requests is called a gateway, or reverse proxy, and allows you to expose multiple web services (i.e. your project services) as a single external web service (i.e. Caddy)

Some HTML
for images do <img src ="" alt="" width=""> and for links it's <a href= "">link text</a>
I can't figure out the <video> tag, but I found that people online recommend the iframe tag instead. So maybe that is something I should look into. Inputs are really cool and I wish I had learned those previously.
I am gonna do some HTML stuff later.
MOre HTML
form method="get" Default. Appends the form-data to the URL in name/value pairs: URL?name=value&name=value I guess this will give me the information to use on the next page. See login in html

1/29/24
~/goes back to the master directory I think. So my reference was ~/keys/production key'
1/31/24
CS id="" we can make this attribute set with #whatever ID

2/16/24
JS
[x,y] = a when a is an array this will assign the first to values of a to x and y
... variatic operator means everything else.

2/17
Goals for JS
Animation for the rotate. Path turns yellow, custom board size. NExt button?

<canvas id="myCanvas" width="100" height="100" style="border:1px solid grey"></canvas>

<script>
const c = document.getElementById("boardofthegame");
const ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(0, 0, 50, 0, .5*Math.PI);
ctx.stroke();
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(100,100,50,Math.PI,1.5*Math.PI);
ctx.strokeStyle="green";
ctx.stroke();
</script> 
//code for two arcs in a canvas
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(0,50);
ctx.lineTo(100,50);
ctx.moveTo(50,0);
ctx.lineTo(50,100);
ctx.stroke();

regex /A|f/i a or f not case sensitive. / / means regexq
queryselector only gets the first one. queryselectall is for all
JSON doesn't use undefined, and uses double quotes. 
To point to another DNS record use CNAME learn about A type
learn about arrow syntax again

can use @import url("")to import a font
From outside to in margin border, padding-space around content, content
const f = y => ++y; console.log(f(3)) out puts 4? div is division
a.reduce((a,v)+> [a,v].join(':')); console.log(b) outputs cow:rat:fish
function is const f =(x)=>{}, function f(x){}, const f =function(x){}
javascript <script></script>, <script src='main.js'/>, <div onclick='1+1'/>
Valid JSON {"x":3}
console command that makes a script executable chmod +x deploy.sh

p= promise(set timeout, console.log taco, resolve true)
consle log burger
p, .then result -shake, catch-salad, finally-noodles
console log fries
burger, fries taco, shake, noodles never throws an error so no salad

a= async(return new promise(set timeout-console log D resolve true))
try(consolelog('a')), await a, console log ('b')
catch(e)(cosnole log C)
ADB

Node.js and stuff
cYou can execute a line of JavaScript with Node.js from your console with the -e parameter.
Use different URL paths in the browser and note that it will echo the HTTP method and path back in the document. You can kill the process by pressing CTRL-C in the console.

Note that you can also start up Node and execute the index.js code directly in VS Code. To do this open index.js in VS Code and press the 'F5' key. This should ask you what program you want to run. Select node.js. This starts up Node.js with the index.js file, but also attaches a debugger so that you can set breakpoints in the code and step through each line of code.

âš  Make sure you complete the above steps. For the rest of the course you will be executing your code using Node.js to run your backend code and serve up your frontend code to the browser. This means you will no longer be using the VS Code Live Server extension to serve your frontend code in the browser.???? I don't think I did somethning right

Curl makes request like Chrome does
echo
Your web service, Caddy, is listening on ports 80 and 443. When Caddy gets a request on port 80, it automatically redirects the request to port 443 so that a secure connection is used. When Caddy gets a request on port 443 it examines the path provided in the HTTP request (as defined by the URL) and if the path matches a static file, it reads the file off disk and returns it. If the HTTP path matches one of the definitions it has for a gateway service, Caddy makes a connection on that service's port (e.g. 3000 or 4000) and passes the request to the service.
when do I choose ports? cannot use port 3000 for your startup service. Instead you use port 4000 for your startup service. It does not matter what high range port you use. It only matters that you are consistent and that they are only used by one service.
TTL
HTTP-request
Where would I put a fetch request?
When am I serializing stuff?

Endpoint design- grammatical, readable, simple, documented
So messy
